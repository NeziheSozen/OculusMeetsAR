\section{Hardware Requirements}\label{hardware-requirements}

Please note that every single part of the following hardware
configuration is optional in the example applications. You do not need
any of the hardware present to develop with ARLib! The hardware we were
developing for: - 2x
\href{http://www.logitech.com/de-de/product/hd-webcam-c310}{Logitech
C310 Webcams} -
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/tree/master/Hardware/Printmodels}{3D-Printed
camera mounts and lens mounts} - 2x
\href{http://www.camera2000.com/en/cctv-board-security-video-camera-1-8mm-lens-f2-0.html}{Fisheye
1.8mm lens F2.0} - \href{https://www.oculus.com/dk2/}{Oculus Rift DK2
Head-Mounted Display} -
\href{http://www.optitrack.com/products/flex-3/}{OptiTrack Flex 3
Tracking System}

Here is an exploded-view drawing of our modified HMD:\\
\includegraphics*{explosion.jpg}
The components from left to right: Oculus Rift DK2, 3D-printed camera
mount, Logitech C310s, 3D-printed lens mounts, lenses.

\subsection{Lens selection and camera
calibration}\label{lens-selection-and-camera-calibration}

Regarding our hardware choices we recommend William Steptoe's
\href{http://willsteptoe.com/post/67399683294/ar-rift-camera-selection-part-2}{documentation
on his project AR-Rift}. According to different user-reports, the actual
horizontal FOV of the DK2, which should be matched by the lenses, is
only about 80°-90°. With our lenses, we got a vertical* FOV of
approximately 75°, so for a more accurate matching one might want to buy
lenses with a smaller focal length. To prevent easy mistakes on your
search for other lenses, we recommend
\href{http://pomeroyprinting.blogspot.de/2014/04/modifying-logitech-c310-hd-webcam.html}{this
post by Brandon Pomeroy}.

*Remark: This is the relevant FOV since the cameras are mounted with a
90° rotation!

For calibration we used Davide Scaramuzzas
\href{https://sites.google.com/site/scarabotix/ocamcalib-toolbox}{OCamCalib
toolbox} along with a small
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/tree/master/Hardware}{stereo
calibration tool}, we implemented using OpenCV. Click
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Calibration}{here} for
a step-by-step guide and technical details.

\section{ARLib}\label{arlib}

This is the main library we are developing here. It is comprised of the
following modules:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Video-Module}{ARLibVideo}:
  The stereo video input library. It grabs real-time video streams from
  the two cameras attached to the Oculus Rift DK2 and provides
  coordinate lookup tables to undistort them according to their lens
  parameters and align them to one another according to their
  precalculated homographies.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Oculus-Module}{ARLibOculus}:
  A small wrapper for LibOVR. Only the needed parts. It initializes the
  HMD, provides the LibOVR configuration parameters and the latest
  LibOVR tracking data.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Tracking-Module}{ARLibTracking}:
  The rigid body tracking library. It uses the NatNetSDK and/or
  ARLibOculus to provide the latest positions and orientations of rigid
  bodies as well as a fraction of their tracking history for retroactive
  queries.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Ogre-Module}{ARLibOgre}:
  The OGRE 1.9 interface library. The only part of ARLib that depends on
  OGRE! Provides all the shaders, materials, render targets and
  abstracted components that can be directly inserted into a scene.
\end{itemize}

\section{ARLib\_Samples}\label{arlibux5fsamples}

We provide two simple example projects that demonstrate the usage of
ARLib within OGRE:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/SimpleScene}{SimpleScene}:
  A simple example scene with some static objects placed around the
  origin.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/RemoteGame}{RemoteGame}:
  A simple game where one has to defend against laser bullets of a Star
  Wars Remote.
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Before starting the stereo calibration, download the
  \href{https://sites.google.com/site/scarabotix/ocamcalib-toolbox}{OCamCalib
  Toolbox} for Matlab provided by Davide Scaramuzza. Use this tool to
  calculate the intrinsic camera parameters for both cameras. We
  recommend our calibration tool to take snapshots for both cameras (see
  3). Rename the two resulting calib\_results.txt to
  calib\_results\_CAM1.txt (left camera) and calib\_results\_CAM2.txt
  (right camera) and place these files at
  /Hardware/Calibration\_Tool/media/
\item
  Connect your webcams to the system and start our
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/tree/master/Hardware/Calibration_Tool}{calibration
  tool}. You will see the main menu.\\
  \includegraphics*{0.jpg}
  Note: We built our system for two Logitech C310 webcams with Logitech
  drivers installed. If you don't want to use Logitech Cxxx cameras or
  the Logitech drivers, you will have to modify the
  \href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/tree/master/ARLib/src/Video}{VideoPlayer.cpp}.
\item
  Take snapshots, which you can use for the stereo calibration (main
  menu option 1). After selecting this option, press SPACE to take
  snapshot or ESC to exit.
\item
  Load the images from the media folder (main menu option 2). The tool
  will list the snapshots.\\
  \includegraphics*{2.jpg}
  Now select the snapshots, you want to use for calibration (simply
  press ENTER to select all). Here we decided to choose the snapshot
  pairs 1,2,3,4 and 7. Then our tool loads and undistorts (according to
  the previously determined ocam models) the images.\\
  \includegraphics*{3.jpg}
\item
  Extract and match keypoints (main menu option 3).\\
  \includegraphics*{4.jpg}
  Select the second option and choose the method for keypoint extraction
  and matching -
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform}{SIFT},
  chessboard detection (using OpenCV's chessboard corner detector), or a
  combination of both.\\
  \includegraphics*{5.jpg}
  If you choose the first or last method, you will have the option to
  check the matches manually.\\
  \includegraphics*{6.jpg}
  If you want to examine the matches manually, for every match you will
  get an image like this.\\
  \includegraphics*{7.jpg}
  Now press the RIGHT ARROW KEY to accept the currently displayed match
  or any other key to reject it. After matching the keypoints of an
  image pair, the console will tell you, how many matches you accepted
  and how many of those were added to the final collection of matches.
  Some correct matches might be discarded because of previously added
  very similar matches.\\
  \includegraphics*{8.jpg}
  For chessboard matching you need to enter the number of inner
  chessboard corners (e.g.~for a standard 8x8 chessboard enter 7 as
  x-size as well as y-size).\\
  \includegraphics*{9_0.jpg}
\item
  Approximate the
  \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipolar_geometry}{epipolar
  geometry} (main menu option 4). With the calculated or selected
  matches we now want to estimate the fundamental matrix as well as the
  homographies, which we can use to rectify our camera streams.\\
  \includegraphics*{9_1.jpg}
  Here we used two methods: 1. The implementation of Hartley's
  \href{http://docs.opencv.org/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html\#findfundamentalmat}{8-point-algorithm}
  from OpenCV, which uses RANSAC for more than 8 points. 2. We
  implemented
  \href{http://publica.fraunhofer.de/documents/N-246139.html}{this
  paper} by Zilly, Müller, Eisert and Kauff.\\
  \includegraphics*{10.jpg}
  If you choose the latter, you can calculate the rectifying
  homographies either according to the mentioned paper or using
  \href{http://docs.opencv.org/modules/calib3d/doc/camera_calibration_and_3d_reconstruction.html\#stereorectifyuncalibrated}{OpenCV's
  implementation of Hartley's algorithm}.\\
  \includegraphics*{11.jpg}
\item
  Visualize the approximated fundamental matrix and homogrphies (main
  menu option 5). This will draw some epipolar lines on the first image
  pair loaded. Furthermore it will rectify theses images. The results
  are saved to the media folder.\\
  \includegraphics*{12.jpg}
  \includegraphics*{13.jpg}
	\includegraphics*{14.jpg}
\item
  If you are satisfied with the results, you will have to copy the files
  homography\_CAM1.txt and homography\_CAM2.txt from the media folder to
  ARLibSamples/media/.
\end{enumerate}

ARLibOculus is just a lightweight single-class wrapper for the needed
parts of LibOVR (the Oculus SDK). Including
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/include/ARLib/Oculus/Rift.h}{ARLib/Oculus/Rift.h}
won't pull any LibOVR header files into your compilation unit. In fact,
it doesn't depend on anything at all!

\section{Example}\label{example}

Usage in an OGRE scene (have a look at the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/tree/master/ARLib_Samples}{ARLib\_Samples}
for more details):

\begin{verbatim}
// create a rift node and add it to the tracking system
riftNode = new ARLib::RiftSceneNode(rift, sceneManager, 0.001f, 50.0f, 1);
tracker->addRigidBodyEventListener(riftNode);

// add a render target that renders to the rift screen (window)
renderTarget = new ARLib::RiftRenderTarget(rift, root, window);
riftNode->addRenderTarget(renderTarget);

// add a render target that renders to an additional debug output screen (smallWindow)
smallRenderTarget = new ARLib::DebugRenderTarget(smallWindow);
riftNode->addRenderTarget(smallRenderTarget);

// attach video screens (riftVideoScreens->update() needs to be called each frame!)
riftVideoScreens = new ARLib::RiftVideoScreens(sceneManager, riftNode, leftVideoPlayer, rightVideoPlayer, tracker);
\end{verbatim}

\begin{center}\rule{0.5\linewidth}{\linethickness}\end{center}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/include/ARLib/Ogre/RiftSceneNode.h}{ARLib::RiftSceneNode}

The RiftSceneNode represents the virtual Oculus Rift device in the OGRE
scene. Especially, it contains the two cameras which represent the eyes.
RenderTargets can be connected to the RiftSceneNode.

\begin{verbatim}
// constructor
RiftSceneNode(ARLib::Rift *rift, Ogre::SceneManager *sceneManager, float zNear, float zFar, unsigned int rigidBodyID);

// the various parts the RiftSceneNode is comprised of
ARLib::Rift *getRift();
Ogre::SceneNode *getBodyNode();
Ogre::SceneNode *getHeadNode();
Ogre::SceneNode *getHeadCalibrationNode();
Ogre::Camera *getLeftCamera();
Ogre::Camera *getRightCamera();

// manually adjustable orientation (useful for mouselook if no actual Oculus Rift device is connected)
void setPitch(Ogre::Radian angle);
void setYaw(Ogre::Radian angle);

// maintain the render targets
void addRenderTarget(ARLib::RenderTarget *renderTarget);
void removeRenderTarget(ARLib::RenderTarget *renderTarget);
void removeAllRenderTargets();
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/include/ARLib/Ogre/RiftRenderTarget.h}{ARLib::RiftRenderTarget}

The RiftRenderTarget is the RenderTarget that renders to the Oculus Rift
screen (in extended desktop mode), using the provided distortion meshes,
vignetting and chromatic aberration correction.

\begin{verbatim}
// constructor
RiftRenderTarget(ARLib::Rift *rift, Ogre::Root *root, Ogre::RenderWindow *renderWindow);
\end{verbatim}

The DebugRenderTarget is a RenderTarget that renders both camera images
next to each other directly to a debug output window. Use this, if you
don't have an actual Oculus Rift connected.

\begin{verbatim}
// constructor
DebugRenderTarget(Ogre::RenderWindow *renderWindow);
\end{verbatim}

RiftVideoScreens manages the streaming and placement of camera images.
The camera images are placed at the location in the scene where they
have been captured (according to their capture timestamp and the Rifts'
tracking data history).

\begin{verbatim}
// constructor
RiftVideoScreens(
    Ogre::SceneManager *sceneManager, ARLib::RiftSceneNode *riftNode,
    ARLib::VideoPlayer *videoPlayerLeft, ARLib::VideoPlayer *videoPlayerRight,
    ARLib::TrackingManager *trackingManager = NULL);

// use these to fine-tune the video image positions and sizes
void setOffsets(Ogre::Vector2 leftOffset, Ogre::Vector2 rightOffset);
void setScalings(Ogre::Vector2 leftScale, Ogre::Vector2 rightScale);

// call this every frame to upload the latest camera images
void update();
\end{verbatim}

stereo output pipeline of ARLibOgre.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib_Samples/RemoteGame/src/GlowRenderTarget.cpp}{GlowRenderTarget}}{GlowRenderTarget}}\label{glowrendertarget}

As you can see in
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib_Samples/RemoteGame/src/GlowRenderTarget.cpp}{GlowRenderTarget.cpp},
attaching
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Ogre-Module}{RenderTargets}
to the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/include/ARLib/Ogre/RiftSceneNode.h}{RiftSceneNode}
can be intercepted (or decorated/wrapped as in the ``decorator
pattern'') by inserting a custom RenderTarget in between the
RiftSceneNode and the actual RenderTarget. In
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib_Samples/RemoteGame/src/GlowRenderTarget.cpp}{GlowRenderTarget.cpp},
the latest viewports for both eye cameras are accessed after they were
attached to add a glow effect compositor.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib_Samples/Common/src/NPRWatercolorRenderTarget.cpp}{NPRWatercolorRenderTarget}}{NPRWatercolorRenderTarget}}\label{nprwatercolorrendertarget}

\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib_Samples/Common/src/NPRWatercolorRenderTarget.cpp}{NPRWatercolorRenderTarget.cpp}
demonstrates a more advanced example for postprocessing. Instead of just
directly rendering and compositing into the destination RenderTarget,
the eye camera images are passed both blurred and unchanged to an OGRE
MultiRenderTarget. The blurred images are used to make voronoi-like
tilings of the input image (the brushstrokes), while edges detected in
the original images are subtracted from the voronoi tilings (sharp
outlines). The results are presented in separate scenes, which are seen
by another set of cameras. Those cameras are finally passed to the
destination RenderTarget.

The whole process is a simplified version of a
\href{http://csnotes.upm.edu.my/kelasmaya/web.nsf/0/d82e709c4661ce464825766400365c4d/\$FILE/p231-chen.pdf}{technique
by Chen, Turk and MacIntyre from 2008}. The idea was that if both, real
images and rendered objects are postprocessed to look like stylized
watercolor paintings, it might be more difficult to tell them apart.

You should read the notes for the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/SimpleScene}{SimpleScene}
first. This is the more advanced example. In addition to the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/SimpleScene}{SimpleScene},
this example includes some physics and gameplay code.

\item
  \textbf{`CTRL'}: Eye selection. The left eye is selected by default.
  While the key is pressed, the right eye is selected.
\item
  \textbf{`D'}: Move the video placement for the selected eye to the
  right.
\item
  \textbf{`A'}: Move the video placement for the selected eye to the

\item
  \textbf{`S'}: Move the video placement for the selected eye down.
\item
  \textbf{RIGHT}: Increase the size of the selected eye horizontally.
\item
  \textbf{LEFT}: Decrease the size of the selected eye horizontally.

\end{itemize}

This is the basic example. It shows the initialization and usage of
ARLib for a simple Augmented Reality task in OGRE. This example can also
be used to test the hardware setup. Please note that none of the
hardware components have to be connected to start this example. It will
tell you in the console/logfile if there were any detected problems. To
keep the example simple, only three static cubes are added to the Scene.
Using the tracking system, you should be able to look and walk around
them and see how stable their appearance is. Using the keybindings
below, you may want to finetune the video positions and sizes as well as
their constant hardware latency for a smooth experience.

  \textbf{RIGHT}: Increase the size of the selected eye horizontally.
\item
  \textbf{LEFT}: Decrease the size of the selected eye horizontally.
\item
  \textbf{UP}: Increase the size of the selected eye vertically.
\item
  \textbf{DOWN}: Decrease the size of the selected eye vertically. The
  Tracking Library supports several methods for real-time pose
  determination and estimation. Along with the tracking devices included
  in the Oculus Rift (both DK1 and DK2), any device using the NatNetSDK
  is supported. The core of this Module is the \texttt{TrackingManager}
  class. It is practically the only necessary interface to fire-up an
  application with tracking support.
\end{itemize}

\section{Initialization of the
TrackingManager}\label{initialization-of-the-trackingmanager}

Initialization of the tracking manager requires the user to hand over
the necessary parameters to the TrackingManager beforehand. First of all
we create an instance of the class while also defining its purpose.

\begin{verbatim}
TrackingManager tManager = TrackingManager(ARLib::ARLIB_NATNET | ARLib::ARLIB_RIFT, frameBufferSize, debugOutput);
\end{verbatim}

where frameBufferSize determines the buffer size for retroactive queries
(more on that later) and debugOutput is a boolean value enabling debug
console output. In this example the tracking manager is set up to
connect to a NatNet Server (i.e Motive etc.) as well as reading tracking
data from the rifts inertial sensors, providing more stability in the
tracking data (there is also support for multiple rifts).

Furthermore the following parameters can (and some have to) be set.

\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}lllll@{}}
\toprule
Function Name & Parameters & Default Values & Description & Necessary
for (NatNet,Rift)\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
setNatNetConnectionType & & none & & (true, false)\tabularnewline
setNatNetClientIP & string serverIP & localhost & The IP address on
which your application runs & (true, false)\tabularnewline
setNatNetServerIP & string clientIP & localhost & The IP address of the
NatNet Server & (true, false)\tabularnewline
setNatNetHostCommandPort & int port & 1510 & Network port for commands &
(false, false)\tabularnewline
setNatNetHostDataPort & int port & 1511 & Network port for streaming
data & (false, false)\tabularnewline
setFrameEvaluationMethod & enum FRAME\_EVALUATION\_METHOD & FRAME\_ROUND
& Inter-Frame evaluation method for retroactive queries & (false,
false)\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Atfer the setting of the required values, the initialize function of the
tracking manager can be called for example in the following way:

\begin{verbatim}
if(ARLib::ARLIB_TRACKING_OK != tManager->initialize()){
    printf("Failed to Initialize Tracking Manager.");
    return -1;
}
\end{verbatim}

Depending on wether the tracking is critical for your application or not
you should exit your program.

\section{Using the Tracking Manager}\label{using-the-tracking-manager}

The tracking manager needs to be updated on a regular basis (i.e.~your
event-loop), if your are using the Oculus Rift. For smooth
transformations, this should happen at least 75 times per second, that
is the frame rate supported by the Oculus DK2, or 60 times per second
for the DK1.

To make objects behave according to the tracking data (i.e.~ridig body
transformations) they have to inherit from the abstract base class
\texttt{RigidBodyEventListener}. On each event cycle the manager will
notify its listeners of any change in their transformations. A
\texttt{RigidBodyEventListener} has a, not necessarily unique, ID, which
is used to create a correspondence between the rigid bodies on the
server (Motive etc.) and the rigid bodies in your application.

For the Oculus there is a specialized \texttt{RigidBodyEventListener}
the \texttt{RiftRigidBodyEventListener}. The \texttt{RiftSceneNode} from
the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Ogre-Module}{OgreModule}
is such a specialized listener. On Registration with the Tracking
Manager, a handle to the rift is saved and queried for positional data
each frame.

\section{Retroactive Queries}\label{retroactive-queries}

The camera images need to be placed in front of the virtual camera,
which is of course a representative of the Oculus. But to reduce the
effect of latency, which is naturally imposed by the webcams, the images
need to be placed where they were at capture time. This solution works
rather nicely in situations where the camera motion is not particularly
fast. When the camera is moving faster the user will experience black
borders at the edge of the screen, because the images could not cover
the whole rendering area. To query the position of the
\texttt{RiftRigidBodyEventListener} one must call the function.

\begin{verbatim}
RigidBody* TrackingManager::evaluateRigidBody(unsigned int ID, const long long& retroActiveQuery);
\end{verbatim}

ID is of course the RigidBody identifier, and retroActiveQuery is the
desired Timestamp formated equavalently to the QueryPerformanceCounter
function.

\section{Cleaning Up}\label{cleaning-up}

If the Tracking Manager is no longer used simply delete the handle to
it. The cleanup will be taken care of by the destructor. 

In order to grab the video from the two Logitech C310 webcams we used the capture
class from Microsofts Media Foundation example
\href{https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee663604\%28v=vs.85\%29.aspx}{MFCaptureToFileSample}
and modified
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/src/Video/CCapture.cpp}{it}.
If you want to use different cameras, video resolution or drivers,
you'll have to modify this class (especially the ConfigureSourceReader
function, where we set the video format). Furthermore you'll need to
modify the camera selection in the constructor of
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/blob/master/ARLib/src/Video/videoplayer.cpp}{VideoPlayer.cpp}.

However if you just want to use the video module with two C310 and the
drivers provided by Logitech, you'll just have to create a VideoPlayer
instance via

\texttt{VideoPlayer(int\ cameraNumber\ =\ 0,\ const\ char\ *ocamModelParametersFilename\ =\ NULL,\ float\ videoDistance\ =\ 4.0f,\ const\ char\ *homographyMatrixFilename\ =\ NULL);}

In order to undistort the video (using the ocam parameters mentioned in
the
\href{https://github.com/ands/OculusMeetsAR/wiki/Calibration}{calibration
section}) and rectify it according to a previously approximated
homography, you need to hand over the filenames. Furthermore we used
cameraNumber 0 for the left and 1 for the right camera. The
videoDistance is similar to a zoom factor applied to the video (look at
\texttt{void\ calculateUndistortionMap(float\ *xyMap)} to see its
effect).

After initialization the videoPlayer will immediately start capturing.
To get a pointer to the current video frame memory in the BGR format,
you then just have to call videoPlayer's function
\texttt{void\ *\ update(LARGE\_INTEGER\ *captureTimeStamp\ =\ NULL);}.

\section{Tips \& Problem solving}\label{tips-problem-solving}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  One camera can be attached to the built-in USB port of the Oculus Rift
  DK2, if the DK2s additional power supply is used.
\item
  We couldn't get more than one video stream over that built-in USB
  port. The second camera needs a separate USB cord.
\item
  Sometimes, the Logitech driver enables a digital zoom (Probably to
  lower the amount of data transferred over a USB root hub). Use a
  different USB port for one of the cameras.
\item
  Camera enumeration seems to happen in exactly the same order each
  time.
\end{itemize}

Project Files
=============
- **ARLib:** The OculusMeetsAR libraries. They can be used to create augmented reality applications with an Oculus Rift DK2, attached cameras and a tracking system. Also features OGRE integration.
- **ARLib_Samples:** Two simple example applications that use ARLib with OGRE.
- **Hardware:** Contains our camera calibration tool and 3D-Printable camera and lens mounts.
- **TrackingTestServer:** A simple tracking system server that rotates a rigid body (to test ARLibTracking without a real setup).

Included Third Party Libraries
==============================
- OGRE v1.9 with Bullet
- LibOVR v0.4.3
- NatNetSDK v2.7
- TinyThread++ 1.1
- OpenCV 2.4.10 (only for the calibration tool)

Building
========
For Visual Studio 2010 with service pack 1 ONLY (if you want to use OGRE v1.9)!

- Execute SET_ENV.bat to set environment variables for all libraries prior to building.
- Open the ARLib solution file and batch build everything.
- Open up the ARLib_Samples solution file and set the working directory for the example projects to "$(TargetDir)" (those are not saved in the Visual Studio project files - don't ask...).
- Build and run the ARLib_Samples.
- Enjoy.
- $Profit.
